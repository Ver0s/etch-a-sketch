# etch-a-sketch

This project took a while to complete. It can still use some improvements but I'm proud of what I did. 
This one taught me a lot about event propagation in javascript. Thanks to that I implemented event delegation in my code which allowed me to attach event listeners to generated containers in a neater way.
